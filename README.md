# React Todo App with API

The Todo List App is a dynamic web application built using React and an API. The app allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks, as well as mark them as completed.

By utilizing an API, the application is able to store tasks, allowing for user data to persist even if they reopen the browser.

The design of the application is minimalistic and user-friendly, featuring a simple layout and visually distinguishable cues for active and completed tasks.
